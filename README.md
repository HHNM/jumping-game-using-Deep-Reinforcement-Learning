# CGP_python_jumpy_game

An Evolutionary Algorithm called Cartesian Genetic Programming is used to evolve an AI to jump on platforms.

The repository contains the following files:

`main.py` : To run the game played using Cartesian Genetic Programming algorithm 

`gameHuman.py` : to play the game using user input (left and right arrow for movement and up arrow to jump)

`CGP.py` : The Cartesian Genetic Programming Algorithm.

`gameAI.py` :  modification on `gameHuman.py` to be played and executed using the CGP instead of user input by a population of players.

`settings.py` : Game settings

`sprites.py` : Game sprites classes (player and platform)

`postprocess.py` : Obtain the math formula and the CGP trees
